*Yo-kai Watch 3* is a role-playing video game for Nintendo 3DS developed by [Level 5](http://level5ia.com/). It is a sequel to *Yo-kai Watch 2*.

The game was first released as *Yo-kai Watch 3: Sushi* and *Yo-kai Watch 3: Tempura* in Japan on July 2016. A third version *Yo-kai Watch 3: Sukiyaki* was released on December that year. This last version â€“ considered the definitive one - was released in Europe on December 2018.

The company in charge of localising the game from Japanese into English, French, Italian, German and Spanish was [Pole To Win](https://www.ptw-i.com/). The whole localisation process of this game was performed in their London office, where **I was part of the Spanish QA testing team** during the summer of 2018.
