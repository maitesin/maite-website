Hello and welcome to my blog!

My name is Maite Clausell and I am a freelance Spanish audiovisual translator and localiser living in London. I am passionate about languages and I spend my free time reading, knitting, playing video games and hanging out with my friends.

The aim of this blog is to share tips with other translation professionals who are starting their career, to share my experience and to talk about language curiosities. among others. Do you find these topics interesting? Then make sure that you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mcm_tradu) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maiteclausell/), as I'll be sharing my posts in there.

Hope to see you soon on my next post!
