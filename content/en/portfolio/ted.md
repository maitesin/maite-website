## Update the Home Page Template

The home page is one of a few special pages that Hugo creates automatically. As mentioned earlier, it looks for one of three files in the theme's layout/ directory:

1. index.html
2. _default/list.html
3. _default/single.html

We could update one of the default templates, but a good design decision is to update the most specific template available. That's not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we'll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.

### Make a Static Home Page

Right now, that page is empty because we don't have any content and we don't have any logic in the template. Let's change that by adding some text to the template.

```
$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <p>hugo says hello!</p>
</body>
</html>
:wq

$
```

Build the web site and then verify the results.

```
