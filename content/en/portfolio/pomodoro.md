*Marinara: Pomodoro Assistant* is a Google Chrome extension developed by Chris Schmich.

This is a productivity extension based on the Pomodoro Technique, which works as a time management assistant and can be added to Chrome from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoroÂ®-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef).

At the beginning of 2018, I started using this extension to help me better manage my time while working. Since it was only translated to some languages, in February that year **I volunteered to translate/proofread it into Spanish and Catalan**.
