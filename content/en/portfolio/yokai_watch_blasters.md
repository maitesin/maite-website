*Yo-kai Watch Blasters* is a role-playing video game for Nintendo 3DS developed by [Level 5](http://level5ia.com/). It is a spin-off based on the mini-game in *Yo-kai Watch 2*.

The two different versions of the game, *Yo-kai Watch Blasters: Red Cat Corps* and *Yo-kai Watch Blasters: White Dog Squad*, were first released in Japan on July 2015 and worldwide in September 2018. Due to its success in Japan, a free expansion - *Yo-kai Watch Blasters: Moon Rabbit Crew*, was released in Japan in December 2015, and worldwide in September 2018.

The company in charge of localising the game from Japanese into English, French, Italian, German and Spanish was [Pole To Win](https://www.ptw-i.com/). The translation of the game was performed in their Glasgow office, while **QA testing - for which I was part of the Spanish team** - took place in the London office at the beginning of 2018.
