**La Panderola** was a kind of tram that run between the years 1888 - 1963 in the area of Castell√≥n de la Plana (Spain), where my family and myself originally come from.

We found this documentary on the Internet by chance and it was narrated in English. As my grandparents used **La Panderola** when they were young, I decided to create Spanish subtitles for the video. Therefore, they were able to enjoy this documentary which brought back really good memories.

You can find the videos with my subtitles in the links below:
