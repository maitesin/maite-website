*Skins* is a British TV series created by Bryan Elsey and Jamie Brittain, which was first broadcasted on television on channel E4 on 25 January 2007.

The series deals with the story of a group of teenagers who suffer different problems such as drug and alcohol abuse, homosexuality, mental illness, teen pregnancy, etc.

As part of my dissertation for my *MA in Audiovisual Translation* (2014), **I provided the Spanish SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf and the Hard of Hearing)** of five scenes from episode 1 series 3 named "Everyone".
