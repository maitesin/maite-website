Paella is one of the most typical foods in the Spanish culture, especially in the Valencian region. The origin of the name “paella” seems to be as controversial as the recipe of this famous dish – each region prepares it in a different way, making some people say that some of those recipes are not “true paella”, however, we won’t be looking into this in this post.

If we focus on the word's etymology, the Spanish Real Academia (RAE) states that the word “Paella” comes from the Valencian language:

In the Valencian region, “paella” is not only the name of the traditional dish, but is also the word used for “pan” or “frying pan”. If we search for this word in a [Valencian dictionary](http://www.diccionari.cat/lexicx.jsp?GECART=0098260), it is mentioned that it comes from Latin through the French *paëlle*, which comes from an early form *patella*, these woould later develop into the word *poêle*, which also means "pan". It would seem that the word *patella* lost its “t” in its transition to Valencian, resulting in *paella*.

In order to add some more controversy, there is the **legend** that the word “paella” comes from the Arab, which could be quite possible as Spain was occupied by the Arabs for around 800 years. It was on the 8th century that rice – the main ingredient in Paella – was brought to Spain by the Arab peoples from the North of Africa.

It is well-known that rich Arabs, such as sheikhs, used to have big parties with lots of delicious food being served to enjoy with their guests. Due to the huge amount of food that was served at those parties and gatherings, there were often *Baqiyah*, – pronounced as “ba’eyya”, quite similar to the Spanish pronunciation of “paella” – which means leftovers.

Nonetheless, those leftovers or *baqiyah* were not thrown away because of religious and economic matters. Instead, these leftovers containing rice, fish and chicken were put together, creating a new dish which was given to the servants and the poor.
