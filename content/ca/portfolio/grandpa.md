**LocJAM** was an online non-profit contest for game translators. For each of its editions, a different short open source game in English was chosen for translation.

The first time I read about this contest was in 2015, when **LocJAM 2** took place. That year they chose a video game for translation and as my passion for video game localisation was beginning to develop, I decided to take part in the contest.

The video game chosen for that year was *Grandpa*, created by Omar Enezi, Abdullah Hamed and Basma Mariki, licensed under a [Creative Commons License (CC BY 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). **If you would like to play this short game in the Spanish version that I provided**, click [here](/grandpa).
