As part of the dissertation of the **MA in Translation and New Technologies: Translation of Software and Multimedia Products** I had to localise several parts of the materials of the video game **The Godfather II** from English into Spanish.

This video game is based on the film **The Godfather II** by Francis Ford Coppola, and was developed by EA Redwood Shores and distributed by Electronic Arts, Paramount Digital Entertainment.

These are the materials that I localised:

* [Guide](/docs/Guide.pdf)
* [Video Game trailer](https://youtu.be/VdxgUg_Pdco)
* [Website](/docs/TheGodfather/www.ea.com/the-godfather-2.html)
