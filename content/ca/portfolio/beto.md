Beto is a Spanish web series about a young adult with no job and little friends. His life is a chaos and even with his parents help, he struggles to make ends meet. People usually take advantage of him, in special, his psychiatrist who scams him continuously.

This web series - produced and filmed in my hometown - has been nominated in several web series festivals and has won two awards.

In September 2015, I decided that I wanted to help the people who created this web series. Since then, in my free time, I have been working on providing the Spanish subtitles, as well as translating the script into English, in order to provide English subtitles.
