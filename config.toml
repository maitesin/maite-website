After finishing my MA in 2014, I decided to stay in England, though I was born and raised near the Mediterranean Sea in Spain. In the years I have lived in England, I have moved around and lived in different places: London, Cambridge and Surrey, to move back to London."""
      paragraph2 = """In 2017 I finished an MA in Translation and New Technologies: Translation of Software and Multimedia Products and worked at the translation team of a marketing company as Spanish Language Lead. Since the beginning of 2018, I am working as a freelance translator, subtitler and localiser and as a videogame QA Tester and proofreader at Pole to Win. In my free time I like to read, knit, play video games and create subtitles for a Spanish web series."""
